The government has increased its social spending to ameliorate these problems but critics question the efficiency and implementation of its national development plan. Nevertheless the conditional cash transfer program which requires participants' children to attend school and have medical check-ups has helped improve educational attainment and healthcare among poor children. Ecuador is stalled at above replacement level fertility and the population most likely will keep growing rather than stabilize.",
        "An estimated 2 to 3 million Ecuadorians live abroad but increased unemployment in key receiving countries - Spain the United States and Italy - is slowing emigration and increasing the likelihood of returnees to Ecuador. The first large-scale emigration of Ecuadorians occurred between 1980 and 2000 when an economic crisis drove Ecuadorians from southern provinces to New York City where they had trade contacts. A second nationwide wave of emigration in the late 1990s was caused by another economic downturn political instability and a currency crisis. Spain was the logical destination because of its shared language and the wide availability of low-skilled informal jobs at a time when increased border surveillance made illegal migration to the US difficult. Ecuador has a small but growing immigrant population and is Latin America's top recipient of refugees; 98% are neighboring Colombians fleeing violence in their country."
