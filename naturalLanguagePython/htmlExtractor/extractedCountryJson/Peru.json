        "Peru's urban and coastal communities have benefited much more from recent economic growth than rural Afro-Peruvian indigenous and poor populations of the Amazon and mountain regions. The poverty rate has dropped substantially during the last decade but remains stubbornly high at about 30% (more than 55% in rural areas). After remaining almost static for about a decade Peru's malnutrition rate began falling in 2005 when the government introduced a coordinated strategy focusing on hygiene sanitation and clean water. School enrollment has improved but achievement scores reflect ongoing problems with educational quality. Many poor children temporarily or permanently drop out of school to help support their families. About a quarter to a third of Peruvian children aged 6 to 14 work often putting in long hours at hazardous mining or construction sites.",
        "Peru was a country of immigration in the 19th and early 20th centuries but has become a country of emigration in the last few decades. Beginning in the 19th century Peru brought in Asian contract laborers mainly to work on coastal plantations. Populations of Chinese and Japanese descent - among the largest in Latin America - are economically and culturally influential in Peru today. Peruvian emigration began rising in the 1980s due to an economic crisis and a violent internal conflict but outflows have stabilized in the last few years as economic conditions have improved. Nonetheless more than 2 million Peruvians have emigrated in the last decade principally to the US Spain and Argentina."
