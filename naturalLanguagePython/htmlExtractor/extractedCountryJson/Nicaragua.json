However income distribution is very uneven and the poor agriculturalists and indigenous people continue to have less access to healthcare services. Nicaragua's total fertility rate has fallen from around 6 children per woman in 1980 to just above replacement level today but the high birth rate among adolescents perpetuates a cycle of poverty and low educational attainment.",
        "Nicaraguans emigrate primarily to Costa Rica and to a lesser extent the United States. Nicaraguan men have been migrating seasonally to Costa Rica to harvest bananas and coffee since the early 20th century. Political turmoil civil war and natural disasters from the 1970s through the 1990s dramatically increased the flow of refugees and permanent migrants seeking jobs higher wages and better social and healthcare benefits. Since 2000 Nicaraguan emigration to Costa Rica has slowed and stabilized. Today roughly 300000 Nicaraguans are permanent residents of Costa Rica - about 75% of the foreign population - and thousands more migrate seasonally for work many illegally."
