On the positive side more children are being vaccinated and more pregnant women are getting prenatal care and having skilled health practitioners attend their births. Bolivia's income inequality is the highest in Latin America and one of the highest in the world. Public education is of poor quality and educational opportunities are among the most unevenly distributed in Latin America with girls and indigenous and rural children less likely to be literate or to complete primary school. The lack of access to education and family planning services helps to sustain Bolivia's high fertility rate - approximately three children per woman. Bolivia's lack of clean water and basic sanitation especially in rural areas contributes to health problems.",
        "Almost 7% of Bolivia's population lives abroad primarily to work in Argentina Brazil Spain and the United States. In recent years more restrictive immigration policies in Europe and the United States have increased the flow of Bolivian emigrants to neighboring Argentina and Brazil."
